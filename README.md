# Module 3 Challenge
# The starter files consist of the following files: Accounts.py, savings_account.py, cd_account.py, 
# and customer_banking.py. The Accounts.py file contains the Account class with methods to set the 
# balance and interest.
# In the savings_account.py file: 
# Import the Account class from the Accounts.py file.
# The function definition for the Savings Account is already given by the syntax Args that defines 
# the variable arguments of balance, interest rate and month, in values of decimal places ("floats") and integers ("int") for whole numbers without decimal places (months), respectively, that must be passed ("Argued") via codes, in order to output results("Returns") of decimal values ("Floats") for the updated savings account balance after adding the interest earned, and also returning the float value of the interest earned: 
# Args:
#   balance (float): The initial savings account balance.
#   interest_rate (float): The APR interest rate for the savings account.
#   months (int): The length of months to determine the amount of interest.
# Results:
#   Float: 
#   The updated savings account balance after adding the interest earned;
#   And returns the interest earned.
